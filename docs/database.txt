a Java application and a database cannot communicate directly, so they need a translator, which in software is called a DRIVER.
• We usually need one translator, the driver.
• We might use two, if we want to introduce a persistence layer such as Hibernate.
• We might use three, if we add Spring Data to easily map records to POJOs and handle transactions easily.

You can use Spring to manage the database connection for you by providing a bean that implements javax.sql.DataSource. 
The difference between a DataSource and a Connection is that a DataSource provides and manages connections.
